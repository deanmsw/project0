# Project 0 - TIC TAC TOE

An interactive browser based game created with javaScript.

## Introduction

__Tic-tac-toe__ aka __Noughts and Crosses__, is traditionally a paper-and-pencil game.

The game is played by two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with __X__ or __O__.

The objective is for a player to succeed in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

The player who achieves this first is the winner.

*__The aim of Project 0 is to bring Tic Tac Toe to the Browser__*.
